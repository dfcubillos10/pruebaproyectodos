# LANLORD
Second proyect, an admin panel for building admins (Lanlords). Helps know which tenant has payed, organize worker's payments and view stats.

## How it was built
Backend in node and mongo. Frontend in React. Routing in express. MERN.

## Deployed on Heroku
For simplicity.

# How to Use
The program is divided in 3:
  1. The tenants panel: you can see here info on each, and toggle if payment is already in. By default it isn't. 
  2. The workers panel: you can see here info on each, and toggle if payment is already out. By default it isn't.
  3. The masters panel: you can see here info on the whole building.
